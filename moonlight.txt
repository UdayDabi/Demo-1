I walk through shadows under moonlit skies
Your face a dream I can't materialize
Every step closer feels like a retreat

[Prechorus]
You don’t know me but I know you
A secret tether pulls me through

[Chorus]
An invisible thread
Pulling me near
Tied to your soul
Though you can't hear
I’m hiding
I’m waiting
I’m barely alive
But this love keeps burning
It keeps me in drive

[Verse 2]
The night whispers secrets I can't say aloud
A silent symphony in the crowd
I vanish before you could see

[Prechorus]
Your laughter haunts like a melody
A ghost in the life I’ll never be

[Chorus]
An invisible thread
Pulling me near
Tied to your soul
Though you can't hear
I’m hiding
I’m waiting
I’m barely alive
But this love keeps burning
It keeps me in drive
